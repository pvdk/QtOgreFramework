QtOgre Framework Installation Instructions
==========================================

Windows
-------

To build QtOgre, CMake (http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html, look
for the "Win32 Installer") is needed. Once it is downloaded, run the beta
cmake-gui. Point the source directory at where you unzipped this source, point
the build directory at where you want to build, generally a subdirectory of the
source directory.

Linux
-----

Navigate to the directory containing this file, then:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make install

This will install QtOgre Framework to /usr/local/. To install to a different
path, pass -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install to the cmake step.
