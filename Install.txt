QtOgre Framework Installation Instructions
==========================================

Windows
-------

To build QtOgre, CMake (http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html, look
for the "Win32 Installer") is needed. Once it is downloaded, run the beta
cmake-gui. Point the source directory at where you unzipped this source, point
the build directory at where you want to build, generally a subdirectory of the
source directory.

Linux
-----

Navigate to the directory containing this file, then:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make install

This will install QtOgre Framework to /usr/local/. To install to a different
path, pass -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install to the cmake step.

QMake
-----
As an alternative to the CMake build system, QMake files were contributed in June 2006.
They are not guarentted to be as up to date as the CMake files but hopefully work as 
expected. If you find and fix any problems with them we would be pleased to hear about it.
