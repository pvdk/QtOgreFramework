3D Widgets
``````````

Embeding Qt widgets inside a 3D scene (like the computer terminals in Quake IV).
This could possibly also be used to draw screen aligned quads for GUI etc?

Some ideas on implementation:

WolfenQt woks by overlaying a QGraphiscView and performing transformations on
the QGraphicsWidgets to align them correctly with the 3D scene underneath. This
seems a bad way to do it.

Instead, perhaps try to find a way to get an image of the widget converted into
an OGRE material. The following two points seem like good starting candidates:

 QPixmap QPixmap::grabWidget(QWidget* widget, ...)
 Perhaps ExternalTextureSource in OGRE
  (http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/manual_69.html)

A second step would involve interaction with the 3D widgets. Would need a way to
tell Qt about ray intersection coords and mouse clicks and for Qt to tell OGRE
what to do in response.
